    <p> What is discrete math? </p>

<p>First let's get a silly point of linguistic confusion out of the way.</p>

<p>
<b>discreet</b> (comparative: more discreet, superlative: most discreet)
<ol>
    <li>Respectful of privacy or secrecy; quiet; diplomatic.</li>
<blockquote>
        <p>With a discreet gesture, she reminded him to mind his manners.</p>
        <p>John just doesn't understand that laughing at Mary all day is not very discreet.</p>
</blockquote>
    <li>Not drawing attention, anger or challenge; inconspicuous.</li>
</ol>


<p>versus</p>

<p>
<b> discrete</b> (comparative: more discrete, superlative: most discrete)
<ol>
    <li>Separate; distinct; individual; non-continuous.</li>
    <li>That can be perceived individually and not as connected to, or part of something else.</li>
</ol>
<p>
 (plus several other technical meanings)
</p>

<p>
So, a discrete mathematician is not one who knows how to keep a secret, but rather someone
who deals with mathematical entities that are distinct, separate, non-continuous.  The real numbers
in the interval <m>(0,1)</m> lie in the realm of continuous math; the rational numbers in the same interval
are a discrete collection. </p>
