  <title> <ndash/> Principles of counting</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> Of course, what we really mean to study in this chapter is not counting <foreign>per se</foreign>, 
      but counting without <em>actually</em> counting<ellipsis/> </p>
    <p> For instance if we want to know how old someone who was born in 1981 is in the year 2024, we could 
      write down a longish list of numbers: 
    </p>
    <p> 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, <ellipsis/> 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024</p>

    <p> and then just count them all (so the dodge I just took by putting three dots in the middle wouldn't 
      be cool),
      or (and this definitely seems like less work) just do the subtraction <m>2024-1981 = 43</m>.</p>

    <p> By the way, one of the approaches above gives a wrong answer. Which? </p>
