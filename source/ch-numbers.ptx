  <title> <ndash/> Numeration</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> 
      There is a cute (extremely dated <mdash/> but cute) video called <q>Little Twelvetoes</q> which was part of the 
      Schoolhouse Rock series, first aired in 1973.  It's worth a look, here's a link to
      <url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqGyUvZP0Zg">YouTube</url>.  The point of the video is to teach young 
      kids the twelves part of their multiplication tables, but an interesting side effect is that it gets us to think
      about whether the numbers going from 1 to 10 is as natural a concept as we think.  Or is it just a side effect of us humans
      having ten fingers on our hands?
