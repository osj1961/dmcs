    Democratus was a Greek mathematician/philosopher.  Despite the name, he doesn't seem to have much to do with the 
    notion of <term>democracy</term>.  He's most famous for promoting the atomic theory of matter.

    Some things are clearly made up of smaller bits. Other things not so much<ellipsis/>  For instance, notice how 
    salt is made up of individual grains, but water doesn't seem to be made of smaller components. Of course, you can 
    crush a grain of salt and get a sort of salty powder, but if your vision is good enough you can discern that this 
    powder is made up of tiny grains.  What happens if you grab some really good tweezers and crush one of those miniature grains?
    Do you get micro grains that, if we crush them, produce nano grains?  Is it possible that this sort of thing could go on
    forever?  Democritus said <q>no!</q> Materials can be broken up into smaller and smaller pieces, but there's a limit to
    this process.  He called the smallest bits of matter <term>atoms</term>
