      Multiple choice questions like the following are common on exams like the GRE and the LSAT.
    </p>

    <p>
    Six students, Ann, Bob, Carla, Daryl, Emma and Frank need to be assigned to 3 groups to work on projects together.
    Ann and Carla refuse to work together.  Bob and Emma insist on working together.  If Carla and Daryl work together, they don't want anyone else in their group.
    Group sizes can range from 1 to 3, but there need to be three groups and everyone must be in a group. </p>

    <dl>
      <li><title>Question 1</title>
        <p> Suppose that Bob is in group 1 and that Carla and Daryl are in group 2.  Which of the following must be true? </p>

    <term>Poker</term> is a very popular card game.  If you're unfamiliar with playing cards maybe stop 
    and consult the internet before reading on. In the most common variations of Poker each player has a 
    <q>hand</q> -- a small set of cards that they can see and which are hidden from the other players.
    Some hands beat other hands, and <mdash/> if gambling is involved <mdash/> the player with the best 
    hand gets to keep the other people's money.  What makes one hand better than another?  While there is 
    a slightly arbitrary ranking of hands due to the ordering of the cards (a pair of threes is better 
    than a pair of twos) the primary ranking has to do with how likely the arrangement of cards in a hand is.
    The lowest ranked hand is called <q>a pair</q> <mdash/> this means there are two cards having the same face value.
    </p>  
    <p>
      For concreteness, we'll only consider hands consisting of 5 cards.  Which is better, having the hand known 
      as <q>two pairs</q> or the hand known as <q>three-of-a-kind</q>?
    </p>
    <p>
      There are multiple ways to answer this.  If you own a fresh deck of cards there is usually one 
      (not used in playing) that gives the odds of each possible hand.  The information is also certainly 
      available somewhere on the web.  You could actually shuffle cards and deal out (say) 100 hands and keep track 
      of how many times each type comes up.  For our purposes, the best approach is to figure out how many of the
      <m>2,598,960</m> possible hands<fn>A good question might be: where the heck did that number come from?</fn>
      contain two pairs and how many contain three-of-a-kind.  Of course, you should probably give your answer a 
      sanity check using using one of the earlier approaches.

        In <xref ref="fig-gallery"/> we see a floor plan for an Art museum. (The entrances/exits are omitted.)
        Your challenge here is to determine whether or not it is possible to take a stroll through the museum,
        beginning and ending in the same room, and passing through each doorway exactly once.
      </p>

      <p>
        Either find such a path, or give a convincing reason why it can't be done.

    <p>
    Block designs were originally created by Statisticians who wanted to scientifically analyze farm productivity.
    Deciding which combinations of fertilizers, pesticides, plant varieties, watering regimens, 
    <foreign>et cetera</foreign> will get you the most food out of each acre of land is a worthy goal.  Unfortunately,
    it might involve doing hundreds 
    of different experiments.  Another unfortunate complication: how do we know that the characteristics of the ground 
    we're planting in are
    uniform?  Maybe the soil, the rainfall, sunlight or other characteristics of the plots of land we're using influence 
    the outcome more than the things we're trying to analyze!
    </p>
    <p>
    The brute force approach would be to try every one of the treatments we're trying to analyze to every one of the plots.
    That would result in a fair bit of complexity.  If there are 7 plots and 7 different treatments, we'd need 49 
    separate sub-experiments!  The main idea in the field of experimental design is to do more with less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose there are indeed 7 treatments and 7 plots of land.  Can we find some way to do fewer than 49 experiments and still 
      be able to figure out what's the best way to grow wheat?  Well, of course the answer is <q>Yes</q> or this subsection
      wouldn't even exist!  The main problem here is to work out a way to do only 3 
      experiments on each plot. Suppose the treatments are <m>\{A,B,C,D,E,F,G\}</m>.  Your task is to come up with 7 
      collections, of three letters each, so that the following rules are obeyed:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Each pair of collections has exactly one letter in common.</li>
      <li>Every letter occurs in exactly 3 different collections.</li>
    </ol>

    <p> There is a phrase, <q>without loss of generality</q> that is so 
      common in math circles it often goes by the acronym <q>wlog</q>.
      It means that you're throwing in an assumption that makes things more concrete, but it's
      all good because the assumption you're making is the sort of thing that just amounts to
      renaming things.
    </p>

    <p> In the current setting, we can say <q>Wlog, the first collection is <m>\{A,B,C\}</m></q> which
      is fine since whatever the three treatments are that appear in the first collection, we could just 
      relabel everything so that they become A, B and C.
    </p>

    <p> Similarly, the rules we are asked to follow assert that there will be exactly two other 
      collections that contain A (and they can't also contain either B or C).  So, wlog, the first three 
      collections are 
    </p>

      <md>
        <mrow> \{A,B,C\} \; \&amp; \; \{A,D,E\} \; \&amp; \; \{A, F, G\} </mrow>
      </md>

    <p> This is pretty cool!  We're almost halfway done (wlog!) You just need to figure out
      the remaining four sets.
    </p>
