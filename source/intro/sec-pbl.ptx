      Multiple choice questions like the following are common on exams like the GRE and the LSAT.
    </p>

    <p>
    Six students, Ann, Bob, Carla, Daryl, Emma and Frank need to be assigned to 3 groups to work on projects together.
    Ann and Carla refuse to work together.  Bob and Emma insist on working together.  If Carla and Daryl work together, they don't want anyone else in their group.
    Group sizes can range from 1 to 3, but there need to be three groups and everyone must be in a group. </p>

    <dl>
      <li><title>Question 1</title>
        <p> Suppose that Bob is in group 1 and that Carla and Daryl are in group 2.  Which of the following must be true? </p>

    <term>Poker</term> is a very popular card game.  If you're unfamiliar with playing cards maybe stop 
    and consult the internet before reading on. In the most common variations of Poker each player has a 
    <q>hand</q> -- a small set of cards that they can see and which are hidden from the other players.
    Some hands beat other hands, and <mdash/> if gambling is involved <mdash/> the player with the best 
    hand gets to keep the other people's money.  What makes one hand better than another?  While there is 
    a slightly arbitrary ranking of hands due to the ordering of the cards (a pair of threes is better 
    than a pair of twos) the primary ranking has to do with how likely the arrangement of cards in a hand is.
    The lowest ranked hand is called <q>a pair</q> <mdash/> this means there are two cards having the same face value.
    </p>  
    <p>
      For concreteness, we'll only consider hands consisting of 5 cards.  Which is better, having the hand known 
      as <q>two pairs</q> or the hand known as <q>three-of-a-kind</q>?
    </p>
    <p>
      There are multiple ways to answer this.  If you own a fresh deck of cards there is usually one 
      (not used in playing) that gives the odds of each possible hand.  The information is also certainly 
      available somewhere on the web.  You could actually shuffle cards and deal out (say) 100 hands and keep track 
      of how many times each type comes up.  For our purposes, the best approach is to figure out how many of the
      <m>2,598,960</m> possible hands<fn>A good question might be: where the heck did that number come from?</fn>
      contain two pairs and how many contain three-of-a-kind.  Of course, you should probably give your answer a 
      sanity check using using one of the earlier approaches.

        In <xref ref="fig-gallery"/> we see a floor plan for an Art museum. (The entrances/exits are omitted.)
        Your challenge here is to determine whether or not it is possible to take a stroll through the museum,
        beginning and ending in the same room, and passing through each doorway exactly once.
      </p>

      <p>
        Either find such a path, or give a convincing reason why it can't be done.
